Turnstile Automation System
This project is a comprehensive turnstile automation system designed to manage and control access through a network of turnstiles arranged in a star topology. The system includes both a server module and individual turnstile modules, ensuring centralized data management and autonomous functionality.

Features
Code Reading: Each turnstile can read access codes to determine entry permissions.
Access Control: The system authorizes or denies access based on the read codes.
Physical Access Management: Upon authorization, the system physically grants access through the turnstile.
Star Topology Network: Turnstiles are connected in a star topology, with the server at the central node.
Centralized Data Management: The server module manages and centralizes data from all connected turnstiles, ensuring synchronized and efficient operations.
Standalone Mode: Each turnstile can operate in standalone mode if the connection to the server is lost, maintaining functionality independently.
Automatic Sync: Once the connection to the server is restored, all data is automatically synchronized to ensure consistency across the system.
Overview
The Turnstile Automation System enhances security and efficiency by integrating both hardware and software components to control access seamlessly. The server module acts as the central hub, managing data and permissions for all turnstiles in the network. In the event of a server connection loss, turnstiles continue to operate independently, with automatic synchronization of data once the connection is re-established.
